**Texas City Sort**

**Purpose:**

Sort Texas cities in alphabetic order along with their attributes

**Implementation:**

The program will read each line from the "L02b zip_code_database.csv" excel file and sort the counties in alphabetic order. For each county, the program will then sort the cities in alphabetic order. For each city, the program will sum the county population, city population, and number of unique zip codes in that city.
